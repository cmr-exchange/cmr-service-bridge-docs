## nREPL

To write new code for CMR OPeNDAP you'll want to start up a REPL. The
primary development REPL for CMR OPeNDAP is a terminal-based nREPL:

```
$ lein repl
```
```text

 __________ ___   ___ _________
/   /_____/|   \ /   |    _o___)                       OPeNDAP support in
\___\%%%%%'|____|____|___|\____\                           NASA Earthdata
 `BBBBBBBB' `BBBBBBB' `BB' `BBB'

/    O    \    _o___)/   /_____/|   \  |  |     O   \/   O   \|    _o___)
\_________/___|%%%%%'\___\%%%%%'|____\_|__|_________/___/%\___\___|%%%%%'
 `BBBBBBB' `B'        `BBBBBBBB' `BBBBBBB' `BBBBBBB'`BB'   `BB'`B'

## Proto-REPL

For those using the Atom editor, CMR Graph also offers support for Proto-REPL.
To this end, the `user` ns has been provied at `dev-resources/src/user.clj`. It
is essentially a wrapper for `cmr.opendap.dev` (and can be removed once Proto-REPL
supports configurable starting namespaces, as `lein` does).


## System

With the REPL up, you're ready to bring up the CMR OPeNDAP system components:

```clj
[cmr.opendap.dev] 位=> (startup)
```

This will start the following CMR OPeNDAP components:

* Configuration
* Logging
* The local LRU caching service
* The CMR OPeNDAP HTTP server for the REST API

as the log messages show:

```
2018-04-07T15:26:54.830 [nREPL-worker-0] INFO cmr.opendap.components.config:62 - Starting config component ...
2018-04-07T15:26:54.837 [nREPL-worker-0] INFO cmr.opendap.components.logging:22 - Starting logging component ...
2018-04-07T15:26:54.845 [nREPL-worker-0] INFO cmr.opendap.components.caching:56 - Starting caching component ...
2018-04-07T15:26:54.855 [nREPL-worker-0] INFO cmr.opendap.components.httpd:23 - Starting httpd component ...
```

A convenience function has been provided for use in the REPL which returns
the dynamic var where the system state is stored:

```clj
[cmr.opendap.dev] 位=> (system)
```

When you're done, you can shutdown the system and all of its components with
this:

```clj
[cmr.opendap.dev] 位=> (shutdown)
```


## Code Reloading

You can reload changed code in the REPL without leaving it.

If you don't have a running system, the quickest way to do this is with
`refresh`. However, this should not be used with a running system.

If you have starte the system, then you'll want to use `reset`. This stops a
running system, reloads the changed namespaces, and then restarts the system.
