## About [&#x219F;](#contents)

The Common Metadata Repository (CMR) is a high-performance, high-quality,
continuously evolving metadata system that catalogs Earth Science data and
associated service metadata records. These metadata records are registered,
modified, discovered, and accessed through programmatic interfaces leveraging
standard protocols and APIs.

The CMR OPeNDAP API allows client applications to integrate core CMR metadata
more easily with provider OPeNDAP deployments.
